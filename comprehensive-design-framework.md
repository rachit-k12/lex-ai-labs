# Complete Website Design Framework & Checklist

_A comprehensive framework for building high-quality, high-converting websites based on Y Combinator Design Review principles_

---

## 🎯 Pre-Design: Strategic Foundation

### [ ] Define Core Questions

- [ ] **What is this?** - Can I explain it in one sentence?
- [ ] **Who is this for?** - Have I identified the specific audience?
- [ ] **What stage am I at?** - Am I early-stage (be specific) or mature (platform)?
- [ ] **What's the primary goal?** - What's the ONE action I want users to take?

### [ ] Authenticity Check

- [ ] Am I avoiding "cargo culting" mature companies (Stripe, Slack)?
- [ ] Am I owning my current stage instead of pretending to be bigger?
- [ ] Is my language specific and direct rather than vague and "platform-y"?
- [ ] Am I using words my actual customers use, not my internal jargon?

## 📐 Information Architecture

### [ ] The Pyramid of Communication

**Top (The Hook) - Must answer in 5 seconds:**

- [ ] Clear headline stating what the product does
- [ ] Who it's for (if niche/specific audience)
- [ ] ONE primary Call to Action
- [ ] Visible without scrolling

**Middle (The Explanation):**

- [ ] Feature explanations with benefits
- [ ] Product demonstrations
- [ ] Social proof

**Bottom (The Deep Dive):**

- [ ] Technical specifications
- [ ] Pricing details
- [ ] Documentation links

### [ ] Content Structure

- [ ] Each scroll depth has ONE primary focus
- [ ] Headers (H1, H2, H3) tell the complete story on their own
- [ ] No critical information hidden behind tabs, carousels, or sliders
- [ ] Content flows vertically (users scroll, they don't click through)
- [ ] Alternating background colors separate sections clearly

---

## ✍️ Messaging & Copy

### [ ] Headlines & Value Propositions

- [ ] Avoid generic claims ("streamline growth," "make forward progress")
- [ ] Use specific, measurable benefits ("Build financial models in 10 minutes")
- [ ] No puns or cleverness that obscures meaning
- [ ] Directly from customer language (ask users how they describe it)
- [ ] Focus on primary use case, not edge cases

### [ ] Specificity Over Jargon

- [ ] Industry terms only if audience definitely knows them
- [ ] Plain English for problem and solution
- [ ] Define the audience explicitly if niche
- [ ] No "mystery meat" - users know what they're getting

### [ ] Copy Best Practices

- [ ] Break up walls of text
- [ ] Writing is design - button labels matter
- [ ] Consistent capitalization (Title Case vs. Sentence case)
- [ ] No typos or grammatical errors
- [ ] "Don't Make Me Think" - zero cognitive load

---

## 🎨 Visual Design & Hierarchy

### [ ] The Squint Test

- [ ] When squinting, the most important element stands out
- [ ] Headline or demo is clearly the focal point
- [ ] Not everything blends together

### [ ] Visual Hierarchy Rules

- [ ] Important = Biggest
- [ ] ONE primary CTA with clear visual priority
- [ ] No split focus (two equal-weight columns competing)
- [ ] Text contrast meets accessibility standards (WCAG AA minimum)
- [ ] Secondary text readable (not thin gray on white/black)

### [ ] Consistency

- [ ] Landing page, docs, and app feel like same family
- [ ] Design tokens established (colors, spacing, typography)
- [ ] Border radius, shadows, and effects consistent throughout
- [ ] Cross-page continuity maintained

### [ ] Visual Logic

- [ ] Clickable elements look clickable
- [ ] Non-clickable elements don't look clickable
- [ ] Logos are legible and properly aligned
- [ ] Spacing is consistent (margins, padding, line heights)

---

## 📱 Responsive & Mobile

### [ ] Mobile-First Checks

- [ ] Test on actual mobile devices
- [ ] Key value proposition visible without scrolling on mobile
- [ ] Touch targets at least 60x60 pixels (thumb-friendly)
- [ ] Columns stack logically on mobile
- [ ] Forms are easy to fill on small screens

### [ ] Cross-Device Consistency

- [ ] Design works on tablet, mobile, and desktop
- [ ] Text remains readable at all sizes
- [ ] Images scale appropriately
- [ ] Navigation adapts to screen size

---

## 🖼️ Product Demonstration

### [ ] Show, Don't Just Tell

- [ ] Actual product screenshots visible (not just abstract imagery)
- [ ] Screenshots of real UI, not mockups (unless pre-launch)
- [ ] For physical products: large, high-quality images
- [ ] For AI/automation: show the output/result

### [ ] Screenshot Best Practices

- [ ] Zoom in on specific features being discussed
- [ ] Blur out irrelevant parts if complex
- [ ] Show product in context (e.g., email tool inside email interface)
- [ ] Screenshots have borders/shadows if on white background
- [ ] No abstract 3D blobs when you can show actual UI

### [ ] Video & Interactive Demos

- [ ] Video duration labeled (lower barrier to entry)
- [ ] Thumbnail/poster image adds value
- [ ] Videos demonstrate specific features, not generic branding
- [ ] Interactive playgrounds don't require login (when possible)

---

## 🎬 Motion & Animation

### [ ] Purposeful Motion

- [ ] Animation guides the eye or explains a concept
- [ ] Transitions help users understand navigation
- [ ] Every interaction has immediate feedback

### [ ] Avoid Distraction

- [ ] Not everything is moving simultaneously
- [ ] Looping animations don't fight for attention against copy
- [ ] Text is stationary when user needs to read
- [ ] No auto-scrolling that hijacks user control

### [ ] Performance

- [ ] Animations don't make site feel slow or "janky"
- [ ] Heavy animations are tested across devices
- [ ] Loading states show immediately (within 1 second)

---

## 🔘 Calls to Action (CTA)

### [ ] CTA Strategy

- [ ] ONE primary CTA per view
- [ ] CTA repeated throughout page (top, middle, bottom)
- [ ] Button text describes the result ("Book a Meeting" not "Submit")
- [ ] Low-risk language ("No credit card required")
- [ ] Contextual to value prop ("View My Savings" vs. "Sign Up")

### [ ] CTA Placement

- [ ] Primary CTA visible without scrolling
- [ ] Sticky/persistent CTA as user scrolls
- [ ] Forms embedded directly (not hidden behind modals)

### [ ] Avoid Paralysis

- [ ] Don't offer 5 equal CTAs (Demo, Docs, Discord, Sign Up, Learn More)
- [ ] Secondary actions visually de-emphasized
- [ ] Clear primary path forward

---

## 🏆 Trust & Social Proof

### [ ] Credibility Signals

- [ ] Customer logos (legible, properly spaced)
- [ ] Specific numbers ("1.1M events" not "lots of users")
- [ ] Press coverage if available
- [ ] Case studies for B2B/enterprise
- [ ] Testimonials with real names, faces, titles

### [ ] For AI/Tech Products

- [ ] Citations and sources for AI answers
- [ ] "Show the work" - visualize what's happening
- [ ] Transparency about how it works

### [ ] For Developer Tools

- [ ] GitHub star count prominently displayed
- [ ] Community links (Discord, Slack)
- [ ] Pricing page (signals sustainability)
- [ ] Open-source health metrics

---

## 🔬 AI-Specific Design (If Applicable)

### [ ] The "Verb" Approach

- [ ] Focus on actions (generate, summarize, auto-complete)
- [ ] Show "thinking process" for long tasks (not just spinners)
- [ ] Canvas/node interface for complex workflows

### [ ] Human-in-the-Loop

- [ ] AI provides drafts, not final auto-executed actions
- [ ] Users can easily edit AI output
- [ ] Prompt scaffolding (examples, templates, suggestion chips)
- [ ] No "blank canvas syndrome"

### [ ] Latency & Feedback

- [ ] Speed is the interface - minimize perceived latency
- [ ] Visual feedback if audio is muted
- [ ] Intermediate steps shown for long processes
- [ ] Loading indicators are informative, not just decorative

### [ ] AI Product Demonstration

- [ ] "Feat of strength" shown immediately
- [ ] Real output displayed, not described
- [ ] Differentiation from other AI tools clearly stated

---
