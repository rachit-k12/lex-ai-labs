## What is Lex AI Club?

Members don't simply consume content; they gain **access to people**. Every interaction inside the club is powered by a curated group of Tier-1 AI professionals from companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon who actively mentor, collaborate, and guide peers on real-world problems.
